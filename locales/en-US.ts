  text_1: `Imprimis is a multiplayer first person shooter that focuses on
          tactical gameplay. Players can change the world they play in whether
          to create fortifications to increase their defensive ability or to
          destroy cover possessed by the enemy.

          Imprimis is an open source game built on the Libprimis engine. All
          assets used to create the game are likewise open sourced.

          With many modern features, including realtime deferred shading,
          volumetric lighting, and tone mapping support, Libprimis' core is
          fast, capable, modern, and fully open sourced. All this combines to
          make an engine that allows for an unprecedented ability to manipulate
          a vibrant and dynamic world using simple, accessible semantics.`,
